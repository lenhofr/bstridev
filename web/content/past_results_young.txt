Commentary
301 Double-in/Double-out was not perfomed by the athletes due to being unnecessary. The winner was already determined.

401 Double-out only had the top 3 finishers.

Points were left on the table... Eric could have used those to get out of the basement!

Commentary
Unlike last year, no one spewed before this year’s Triathlon. Unless they were couth enough to do it at home.



Mike Williams started out strong with 194 to win the first game of bowling.

After coming in 2nd last year, he was hoping this was a sign of good things to come (it wasn’t).

Rob stepped up the heat by bowling a 225 the second game of bowling for a dominating win.

That moves the total 200 games bowled in the Next Generation Triathlon to double digits…10. Congratulations!!!

Joe matched Mike W.’s 194 in the third game to win that round.

The triathletes stepped up their skills…

There were four 500+ series bowled this year. There were none last year. Watch out Old Boys…

Rob and Joe were tied at the top with 5 points each after bowling.



8-ball and 9-ball were both pretty tight.

Rob won 8-ball by only having one loss, to Justin…12 wins

Jesse was right behind him with just 2 losses, to Rob and Mike W.

Brandon was a respectable third with 10 wins.

9-ball was a little closer.

Josh came in first with 10 wins.

Followed by a 3-way tie for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th with 9 wins by Rob, Kyle, and Zach.

After a playoff…Rob came in 2nd. Zach took 3rd and Kyle took 4th place.

Justin had no problem winning the Run by dropping 8 balls.

There was a 4-way tie for the next four spots with 7 balls made.

Rob got 2nd place by dropping 5 balls in the shoot off.

Mike L. got 3rd place by squeaking in 2 balls.

Josh and Mike W. had to go into triple overtime after making 0 balls in round two.

Mike W. got 4th place by making 3 balls to Josh’s 1.

An honorable mention to Eric Arlinghaus for not making any balls in either of his initial attempts.



Rob took an almost insurmountable lead into darts.

After bowling he had 12 points with Joe being the closest to him with 5 points.

All was somewhat calm to this point. I think this is when the serious drinking began.



I was not present for the first game of darts (Cricket).

Rick (The White Bitch) and I went to get the boys some sustenance in the form of 60 White Castle cheeseburgers…Yum!!!

Everyone seemed a bit loopier than when we left them.

Brandon won Cricket. Followed by Eric A. and Kyle.

This mathematically clinched the Triathlon win for Rob.

The joy of observing 13 well-oiled math whizzes followed.

Joe made his late surge to win 401 Double Out. Followed by Justin and Eric R.

The final game was 301 Double In/Out.

The three least drunk triathletes(just kidding…they were all drunk by now) made a final move for some cash.

Jesse won 301. Followed by Mike L. and Brandon.



Rob won his fourth Triathlon in 9 years by 4 ¼ points over Joe.

Still just Lenhof’s and Egan’s on the trophy.



Next year is the 10th Annual Next Generation Bar Sports Triathlon. I believe Las Vegas will be the host city in 2019. Dates to be determined.

Commentary
This year’s Triathlon started with a certain past champion eliminating the previous night’s leftover alcohol residue from his system (Spoiler Alert…he came in 10th)
Jake started his third attempt at the Triathlon trophy with a dominating 158 to win the first game of bowling.
Justin was just 6 pins behind with a 152.
Kyle kept pace by scoring a whopping 165 to take first place in game two.
Mike Williams was a mere 3 pins behind with a 162.
Eric Arlinghaus spread out the points by winning the final bowling game with an overall high score of the day of 168 (no one else was close).
That leaves the total number of 200’s in the history of the Next Generation Triathlon at “9”.
Even with historic low scores by everyone, Zach Jones may have broken the nickel payout record with his 3-game series of 185 (55,62,68)
Dave Lenhof was not there to congratulate Zach for beating his 224 series from last year.
Jake took the early lead after bowling with 5 points…With Mike W. close behind with 4 ½.

Pool was a battle in all 3 games.
8-ball went down to the last game between Jake and Rob…both with 10 wins.
Jake pulled out the win to take first in 8-ball.
Eric Ridpath did not need a playoff to win 9-ball with 10 wins.
Rob was a close second with 9 wins.
Brandon showed signs of life by powering 5 balls in to win the Run.
Justin came in second with a playoff win in Run over Mike Williams (both had 4…Justin 2 – Mike W. 1 in the playoff)
Jake upped his lead going into Darts with a total of 8 with Mike W. still behind with 5 ½.
And don’t count out the Egan boys with Brandon 4 ¾, Kyle 4 ¼, and Justin 4 ¼.

Mike Williams took the lead by winning Cricket.
Kyle also closed the gap by coming in second…Justin third.
It looked like Jake would get his 2 ½ point lead back by going out first in 401.
But Mike L. was starting to recover from the “Fur of the Dog” and tied him along with Jesse.
The three-man bullseye shoot-out was won by Jesse, then Mike L., and Jake got third to take a ½ point lead going into 301.
Jake squelched any suspense in 301 by going out in 6 rounds to clinch his first title in 3 attempts.

The pattern has been broken…Lenhof, Egan, Lenhof, Egan, Lenhof, Egan, Lenhof, Lenhof

Curious…6 champs in the Next Generation Triathlon and 6 champs in the original Bar Sports Triathlon.

Commentary
Kyle put the heat on early by winning the first two games of bowling with a 190 & 201 games. He started both games with 4 strikes in a row.
Brandon stayed in the hunt by winning the last game with a powerful 211 (the 9th total 200 game in Next Generation history).
Rob also held strong by posting two 2nd place finishes in games 2 and 3.
There were some rough scores (see above) by the non-winning bowlers. Lots of nickels were paid in all 3 games.
David Lenhof may have set a new low with a 224 series and a new high in nickels paid.

Brandon closed the gap a little by winning 8-ball with 9 wins.
Rob and Mike L. were right behind in 8-ball with 8 wins a piece.
Kyle (usually a dominate force in pool) could only squeeze out 5 wins in 8-ball. He accomplished this feat by only making the 8-ball once (you figure it out).
Rob stepped up by winning 9-ball with 8 wins and taking the tie-breaker from Mike L. who also had 8 wins.
Brandon kept it close by breaking a 4-way tie for 3rd in 9-ball with a playoff sweep.
Kyle was blanked in 8-ball and 9-ball and lost his lead to Rob.
Then came the Run…
Rob broke Joe’s Triathlon record of 8 balls pocketed (2015) by making 10 for a new Next Generation record.
Eric R. and Kyle were tied for 2nd with 5 balls pocketed. Eric R. won the shoot out by dropping 3 to Kyle’s 2.
Four were tied for 4th & 5th place with 3 balls pocketed. Mike L. took 4th by dropping 4 in the playoff and Mike W. took 5th with 3 balls pocketed.
No one had 0 this year. Josh was low with 1 ball pocketed.

Rob had a 4 point lead over Brandon and Kyle going into darts.
Many a lead has been lost late in the past due to darts and booze.
Eric R. helped Rob out by winning Cricket and Rob pulled a 2nd place finish to pad his lead.
Rob took the wind out of Kyle and Brandon’s sails by winning 401 Double-out and clinching the 7th Annual Triathlon…Congrats!!!
Mike W. won the last game of darts, 301 Double-in/out.

The winning shot was placed in the trophy and Rob took it down like a 3-time champ.
Not sure what the shot was. It wasn’t bourbon or tequila. It was something fruity…similar to most of the bowling scores earlier in the day and the PG version of Rack City (Chick).

It’s not too early to pick your winner for next year. We have a pattern going…Lenhof, Egan, Lenhof, Egan, Lenhof, Egan, Lenhof.

Commentary
Rob emulated his little brother’s 2014 start by taking an early lead in bowling by rolling a 193 and 225 (possibly the highest 200 bowled in Next Generation history) and winning the first two games.

Josh rolled the first 200 of his life in game three…he had a 200 on the nose. ( With the 2 this year, the Next Generation now has 7 total 200’s in its young history)

There was only one sub-100 game rolled (also a Next Generation record) by Eric…a whopping 98 in game 2. That was a lot of nickels paid to Rob for his 225.

Brandon was dominating in game one of bowling until he opened in the 9th and 10th frames to allow Rob to pull out the first game win.

Brandon did not mentally recover until we got to darts.

Jesse received his first of many client calls at the beginning of game two. He proceeded to bowl with the ball in one hand and phone in the other.

It did not hurt him at all. He rolled his high game of the day…127. That’s the sign of a top-notch agent.

Justin won 8-ball with 9 out of 11 wins.

Rob was second with 8 wins.

Eric and Mike L. both had 7 wins to come in third and fourth in 8-ball.

Kyle (The Hustler) won 8 out of 11 games in 9-ball to pull out the win…What the???

I think all the other Triathletes were iced and the tide turned for Kyle when during the wave of Hip-Hop and Classic Rock on the jukebox someone (Rob) slipped in the Frozen classic, “Let it Go”.

The entire pool room joined in for the sing-a-long.

Brandon, Rob, and Eric all had 7 wins to come in second, third and fourth in 9-ball.

The Run had its highest overall ball-count in the 6-year history.

Joe dominated with 8 balls pocketed.

Justin was second with 6 balls made.

It took Jake a while to figure out he had to rack all 15 balls instead of just 4 (from the Jr. Triathlon days…when no alcohol was involved).

But he gathered himself and dropped 5 balls to come in third for his only point of the day.

Three fellas had a powerful 1-ball run (Nick, Rob, and Mike W)

But Kyle would not be outdone with his 0-balls made on both attempts.

Going into Darts, Rob had a 2 ¾ pt. lead on Kyle, 3 pt. lead on Justin, and 3 ¼ lead on Joe.

Lots of Tri to go…

Justin won Cricket to tie Rob and Joe came in second to stay in the race. Rob was blanked. Tequila shots were taken.

Justin won 401 Double-out to take a strong lead. Rob pulled out 4th place to get ½ point and fell behind Justin by 2 ½ pts.

Justin came in third in 301 Double-in/out to clinch his first Triathlon win…Congrats!!!

Mike L. somehow went from a dominating win last year in Nashville to scoring a staggering ½ pts. this year.

The alcohol consumption was steady throughout the day…but tame compared to Nashville.

The tight race kept the shots to a minimum…until after the win by Justin.

Justin powered through the trophy shot without losing his lunch…very impressive.

How did the Next Generation theme devolve from “Rack City” to “Let it Go”?

Commentary
Mike Lenhof took an early lead in bowling by scoring a 203 and 210 in the first two games (the 4th & 5th 200’s in Next Generation history).

He tried to spend all the nickels he won throughout the rest of the day…but could not.

There were 3 sub-zero games rolled. Nick 96, Eric R. 92, and Rob 87…Congrats.

Eric A. won the last game of bowling with a 180. That was the highlight of his day.

Rob won 8-ball with 8 out of 11 wins.

Brandon also won 8 games but lost the head-to-head to Rob.

Jesse, Justin, & Mike L. were all tied with 7 wins in 8-ball.

Mike L. won 9-ball with 8 out of 11 wins.

Josh also won 8 games but lost the head-to-head to Mike.

Rob was right behind them with 7 wins in 9-ball.

The Run was even closer than 8-ball & 9-ball.

Four triathletes were tied for 1st with a staggering 4 balls pocketed (2 less than last year’s max by Kyle).

Brandon won the shoot off by dropping 3 balls in double overtime to edge out Mike L., Kyle, and Rob.

Going into Darts, Mike L., had a 5 ½ pt. lead on Brandon, 8 pt. lead on Rob, and 8 ¾ lead on Eric A.

It was far from over…

Brandon won Cricket, Mike L. was blanked. The lead was down to 2 ½.

Brandon came in 4th in 401 Double-out. Mike L. was blanked and swanked. The lead was down to 2.

Brandon was finally blanked in 301 Double in/out (thanks to Rob & Eric R.). Mike L. came in 5th and won his first Triathlon by 2 ¼.

A tip of the hat to the amount of alcohol consumed at this epic Triathlon.

I believe all Triathletes held their cookies till the end of the competition.

But several painted the porcelain afterwards…no names.

The Nashville karaoke scene will never be the same.

Commentary
Brandon put an early hurtin’ on the other triathletes in bowling by almost sweeping the event with 3 games of 169, 169, and 204.

Kyle stopped the sweep by tying the 204 in the final game and winning the roll-off with a powerful 7-count to Brandon’s 6-count.

Little did Brandon and Kyle know that 1 point would be the difference in who won the triathlon.

I believe the 204’s were the 2nd and 3rd 200’s ever bowled in the young Next Generation history.

High series was Brandon with a 542 and Low series was Mike Lenhof with a 318 (2 games below 100…93 & 94).

Mike Lenhof won 8-ball with 11 out of 13 wins.

Eric Ridpath won 9-ball with 10 out of 13 wins.

Kyle somehow dominated the pool Run with 6 balls pocketed without possessing the ability to break a rack of balls.

Four were tied with 5 balls pocketed. Josh Nezi dropped a staggering 10 in-a-row (tying the record) in the tie-breaker to come in 2nd in the Run.

Going into Darts, there were several triathletes that could still bring home the trophy.

After Cricket, Eric won and took the overall lead.

After 401 Double-out, Mike L. won and Kyle & Eric were now tied for the lead.

Rob won 301 Double-in/out, Eric & Brandon were blanked and Kyle came in 5th to get ¼ point to win the Triathlon by that ¼ point.

Commentary
The day started out on a mellow pace with most of the triathletes agreeing to delay the start of drinking until at least the 2nd game of bowling.

That was until Kyle showed up with 2 buckets of beer before the first frame of the 1st game of bowling was completed.

It was GAME ON after that.

Eric took a healthy and early lead after bowling and held a 3 point lead going into darts.

Rob took the lead after winning Cricket & 401 Double-Out.

The triathlon win was clinched for Rob after Mike W. & Mike L. came in 1st & 2nd in 301 Double-In/Out.

Other Highlights (and Lowlights)


Dustin & Brenton were blanked in every event. But they did blow the highest on the breathalyzer. Their Blind Doubles partners (Eric & Mike L.) want a redraw.
Eric had high series in bowling with a 517 (the only 500 series).
Justin had the high game in bowling with a 186.
Joe had the only sub-100 game ... a 97 in game #2.
Kyle actually got ¼ point in pool by beating 6 people in 8-ball (names withheld by request)
Rob only lost 1 game of 8-ball (to Brandon) and set the Run record of 10 balls in-a-row.
Brenton & Nick are barred from the “Big Boy” table from now on.
There seemed to be a lot of math issues on board #4 during darts. Calculators will be mandatory next year.
