Commentary
We started with Darts this year and what I thought would be a sober beginning to a long, long, day.
I was wrong…


Dave G. started out hot with a win in Cricket
Mike was second, Gary third, Brandon fourth, and Bob was fifth
Glen took the win in 401 Double Out
Gary came in second, Bob was third, Ron fourth, and Dave F. was fifth
History was made in 301 Double In/Out with a first ever 1st Place finish by DAREN…Woo Hoo!!!
Gary came in second, Brandon was third, Dave F. fourth, and Mike was fifth
That gave Gary the early lead with 5 points, followed by Daren and Dave G. with 3 points, and Mike with 2 ¼ points
We slithered out of the Irish Pub and headed for Bowling
In another history making game…more history was set when Shawn won the first game of bowling with a dominating 200
Bob came in second, Ron was third, Dave F. was fourth, and Brandon was fifth
Lightning struck thrice with a win by Dave F. in the second game of bowling with a strong 192
Dave G. was second, Ron was third, Glen was fourth, and Shawn was fifth
Not to be outdone, Bob won game three with a killer 224
Gary was second, Glen was third, Dave G. was fourth, and Ron was fifth
Gary was still in the lead after bowling with 7 points, followed by Bob with 6 ¼, Dave G. 5 ½, Glen 4 ½, and Dave F. 4 ¼
Thrilling and soaking in booze, we crept up the road the final event
Bob swept everyone in 8-ball
Shawn came in second with only 2 losses, Dave G. was third, Glen was 4 fourth, and Daren was fifth
Dave G. won 9-ball with only 2 losses
Glen was second, Shawn was third, Gary (in a drunken haze) was fourth, and Bob was fifth
So…going into the Run, Bob and Dave G. were tied for the lead with 9 ½ points
Gary was within reach with 7 ½ and Glen with 7 points. Shawn was just out of reach with 6 ¼
But the Run was, pardon the pun, a Runaway. Bob dropped 11 balls to win his 9th Championship
Ron had a respectable second in Run with 7 balls, and then the remaining drunks (I mean sharks) had either 2 or 1 ball runs
History Making!!!


Other records this year…
Longest ever Pool event: 6 hours on the button
Most shots without a hurl: Gary, Shawn, Brandon, Dave F., and Ron (Honorable mention to the rest of us. We were only 3 or 4 shots behind them)
Most guys in bed by 10pm (3 out of 4 nights)
Largest single Hooters tab: Brandon (Not as much as the bar tab…but pretty impressive)
Largest ever bar tab (by far): Shawn (Not sure of the exact amount…slightly under 4 digits)

A shout out to Shawn for giving me 3 to 1 odds that I would not win the Triathlon.
Money won is twice as sweet as money earned.

There are now three 9-time champs. Who will reach number 10 first?
We may find out in 2021.

Commentary
10 of the 11 core triathletes competed this year. Hopefully we’ll have all 11 next year for the 35th Annual in sunny Tampa, Florida in 2020 (details coming soon).



Dave Gregory won the first game of bowling with a respectable 205 game

Gary and Mike tied with a 179. Gary won the one ball roll off to get second place

Gary rode that tide and won the next two games of bowling with a 233 and 246

After bowling Gary was leading with 8 points. Dave G. and Ron were in second with 3 points each

Gary kept the heat on by winning 8-ball. Bob was a close second

Bob won 9-ball with Dave G. in a close second

Gary won the Run with an impressive 5 balls pocketed. The Next Generation would be shakin in their boots

After Pool, Gary had an almost unsurmountable lead with 14 points

Bob was a distant second with 7 ¾ , Ron had 6, and Dave G. had 5 ¾

BUT IT WASN’T OVER YET…on to Darts

Dave G. won Cricket and Bob came in second

Gary was blanked…and the lead was shrinking

Bob won 401 and Gary was blanked again…Oh My, the lead was down to 1 ¼ points going into the last game of Darts

After herding the cats…I mean the drunken triathletes, we started the 301 double in/double out game

Gary took a desperation shot of Crown Royal Apple to refocus

It unfortunately worked.

Gary won 301 to clinch his 9th Triathlon championship. Dave G. came in second and Bob sadly came in third in 301

EPIC!!!

Commentary
3 of our core 11 triathletes did not participate this year…Daren (Happy 21st to Brooke), Dave L, and Glen.

The remaining 8 gave it their all during a grueling day of competition.

Bob slowed Gary down and won game three with one of the only two 200 games all day…233

Gary came in second though with the other 200 game of the day…212

Shawn and Rick were generous in their nickel donations the last game by saving their sub-100 games for last…95 & 95

After Bowling Gary had an impressive 8 points and Bob was close behind with 6 points

Pool was a whole different story…

Rick and Mike both led 8-ball with only two losses each

Dave G. was third and Gary was fourth in 8-ball

Mike and Dave G. led 9-ball with two losses each

Gary came in third by dropping 5 balls

It was a tight race going into Darts…

After a lovely, civilized, sit-down meal at Rio Grande we proceeded to Darts

Dave G won Cricket to take the lead

Bob came in second to give him a glimmer of hope

Gary came in fourth to get a needed ½ point

Mike won 401 to get back into the running

Gary came in second to stay alive

Dave G took fourth to get a ½ point

Going into the final game of 301 the Triathlon was still in reach for 3 players…this may be a first

Dave G. had 12 ½, Gary had 12 points, and Mike had 10 ½

Ron won 301 and knocked out Mike’s hopes for his first Triathlon win

Gary came in second in 301 to notch his 8th Triathlon championship…How exciting is that???

Commentary
We thought it was going to be another predictable year…

Dave Gregory was riding the momentum of winning the last 2 years.

Gary John made his return after a two year layoff.

Bob Lenhof was rejuvenated after a disappointing showing in Vegas.

The other Triathletes expected nothing but one of these 3 veterans to run away with the trophy.

And then the Triathlon began…

The wind began to switch…the house began to pitch…and suddenly the hinges started to unhitch


Like the warrior he is, Ron drug himself out of bed with a pulled groin and broken left clavicle in order to participate this year
Ron powered through the first game of bowling and scored a 206 for the win. Gary was a close 2nd with a 180
Bob jumped back in game 2 by finishing with 4 strikes in a row for a dominating 179 and a 1 pin win over Dave Gregory
The momentum continued for Bob with a surprising 243 in game 3 for the win
Dave Foreman bowled the only other 200 this year with a 203 in game 3 for second place
The Next Generation would have loved to bowl against us this year
Ron hopes to have his balls healed by next year and Dave Foreman hopes to have his ball re-drilled by next year
8-ball and 9-ball were really tight this year
Bob and Ron tied with 7 wins in 8-ball. Ron won the head-to-head tie breaker to take the 8-ball event
Three others were tied with 4 wins in 8-ball. After a playoff it went to Gary(3rd), Dave Foreman(4th), and Dave Gregory(5th)
9-ball had a three-way tie for 1st with 5 wins for Dave Gregory, Ron, and Mike
After the playoff it was another win for Ron with Mike coming in 2nd and Dave Gregory coming in 3rd
The Next Generation would have really loved to be in the Run event
Dave Gregory rose above the stink by making 6 balls to come in 1st
Ron was second with 5 balls pocketed. Gary and Dave Foreman both dropped 4 balls. Dave Foreman won the shoot off by dropping 7
Daren squeaked out his ¼ point total with a 5th place showing by putting in 3 balls
Ron has built a strong lead going into Darts with 12 ¼. 3 ½ over Bob, 5 ¼ over Dave Gregory, and 7 ¼ over Dave Foreman
There was only one force on earth that could stop this abomination…TEQUILA
So of course we took a lunch break at Rio Grande and pitchers of margaritas (frozen and on the rocks) were ordered
Hold on to Toto. We’re not in Kansas anymore
It looked like all would be right again when Gary won Cricket, Rick 2nd, and Ron came in 3rd
But Oh No
Ron won 401 Double-out and clinched his first win after 30 years of Triathlon anguish
Ron put a little icing on the cake by also winning 301 Double-in/out
I believe that gives him the most points scored in a Triathlon with 19 ¼ (I’d have to check the annals)

Commentary
We finally succeeded in starting off the Tri with the Darts event after many years of trying

Brandon had early momentum with a win in Cricket and 401 Double-out

Ron kept his hopes alive with a win in 301 Double-in/out

Even though Darts was the first event, there were still many struggles with the math (by both the public and parochial educated)

I believe all the participants were pleased by the establishment by giving the beer, the food, and the barmaid at the Crown and Anchor a standing ovation (in their pants)

Bowling was a learning experience, to say the least

Ron felt history in the making by winning the first game with a staggering 183 game

Dave Gregory would not be outdone and won the second game with an equally impressive 190

Dave Foreman squashed both of those scores by logging the only 200 game of the event with a beautiful 210 in game three

I can’t list all of the horrific scores because of obscenity laws. But it was worth it for Ron to be the only one to bring his own ball with a high 520 series

The low series (297) and game (77) goes to Rick

Daren could have scored in all 3 events and got a ¼ point in bowling if he could pick up more than 2 pins on his final ball in game 2

The heat was on going into Pool. Ron with 11 pts., Brandon with 9 ¼ pts., and Dave G. with 8 ¾ pts.

Dave G. won 8-ball and Ron won 9-ball to make the scores Ron 14 ¼, Dave G. 12 ¾, and Brandon 10 ¾

We were about to see history…

Brandon did not help the tension in the air by taking control of the jukebox and playing “Under Pressure” by Queen 3 times in a row

The Run was less than epic, to say the least

Dave G. won by dropping 6 balls, Dave F. was second with 4, and a four-way tie for third with 3 balls was won by Brandon by making 4 balls in the run-off

Ron and Rob tied for seventh and eighth with 2 balls made

History was written…Dave Gregory won his record 9th Triathlon and Ron came in second (again) with the exact same score they ended with last year ( a mere 1 ½ points difference)

Congrats to Dave Gregory for his 9th win and 7th win in the 21st century

Thanks to Daren for showing us all that sleep is really not necessary for human survival.

Thanks to Twin Peaks for…just being there.

Thanks to Jesse for being there to drive…sort of.

Thanks to Justin for designing a classic 30th anniversary shirt.

Thanks to the women for not bugging us too much during our GUY trip to Vegas.

Thanks to the women that could not make it. If your spouse/boyfriend said he lost money…he’s lying. Everyone won hundreds of dollars. Ask him for your share.

Commentary
Ron Toole (The original Bridesmaid) started out with an impressive lead after bowling, scoring 2 wins and a 2nd place…8 points out of 9

Dave G. rolled a 267 the first game of bowling…edging out Ron’s 243

Bob & Ron had the only other 200’s after that in the last game. A 203 & 206 respectively

Ron could smell his first title

Ron could not get anything going in pool…5th place in 8-ball, did not score in 9-ball, and a respectable 3rd place in Run

Dave G. almost swept 9-ball with his only loss to Glen

Bob had an awesome Run of 15 balls followed by Dave G. with 14 balls pocketed

Ron started smelling something else

After pool, Dave G. took the lead, Ron was a tight 2nd followed by Bob

Dave G., Ron, and Bob were all within less than a point of each other going into the last game of darts. Whoever placed ahead of the other 2 would win the title

Dave G. clinched his record 8th championship by winning the last game of darts

Congrats to Mike Lenhof in his first Triathlon appearance and scoring in each event…slightly

Ron drowned his very familiar sorrows afterwards by donating more cash to everyone in a stimulating Golden Tee tournament

Commentary
Another epic year. Gary clinched his second win in a row after the 2nd game of darts.

We now have a 3-way tie for most wins in the Tri with 7 wins…Gary, Dave Gregory, and Bob.

Everybody made the scorecard again…barely.

After a scratch from Mike Dill and late scratches from Dave Lenhof & Ron Toole it was decided to allow a couple Next Generation entries.

Brandon was the only one to accept the challenge.

And yes, you are reading the results correctly. Brandon had a career performance and outscored 3 prior champions to come in 2nd overall.

Other Highlights (and Lowlights)


The lane conditions at Western Bowl were not conducive to practically all the bowler’s styles. Therefore only two 200 games were bowled.
Gary won 2 games and a 2nd place to take a strong lead after bowling.
Daren continued his late meltdown in bowling by opening in the final 4 frames of game 3 to miss out on a 2nd place finish.
Pool was pretty tight in 8-ball & 9-ball with Dave Gregory winning 8-ball and Shawn winning 9-ball.
Bob & Brandon tied with an 8 count in the Run. Brandon won the Run-off with 4 balls to Bob’s 1…ouch.
Bob won Cricket to get back into the hunt.
But Gary came in 2nd in 401 to clinch the championship.
Brandon confirmed his overall 2nd place finish with a win in 401 & 301.
Four of the top 5 finishers were part of the Elite-5 (as it should be).
The 2 top drinkers were by far Shawn & Dave Foreman. Both put down every mixed drink that Edgewood Tavern could serve. I think they confused them with shots…they drank them just as fast.
Lots of poker money was saved since Dave Foreman got looped at Edgewood. We cannot thank him enough.

Commentary
Another epic year. Gary clinched his first win in 9 years after the 2nd game of darts.

Everybody made the scorecard again.

Gary seemed to benefit the most from taking a year off by winning it all.

Dave Lenhof & Shawn on the other hand seemed a little rusty after their down time.

Other Highlights (and Lowlights)


Glen, Rick, Mike, & Daren are already planning monthly bake sales to build their nickel count for next year’s bowling event after being blanked this year.
Dave Foreman continues to surge in bowling. But apparently it’s affecting his pool & dart performance.
Glen Storer swept Bob Lenhof in 8-ball & 9-ball to prevent him from clinching both games.
Dave Lenhof dominated the Run in pool with a staggering 7 balls pocketed.
Glen Storer buried the cue ball twice after two powerhouse breaks to score a double-donut in Run.
Gary dominated by winning 2 games of bowling (+nickels) and 2 games of darts.
The top 4 finishers were part of the Elite-5 (as it should be).
Almost 60 White Castle hamburger, cheeseburger, and jalapeno cheeseburgers were consumed after the triathlon. The 2013 training has begun.

Commentary
What a year!

This was one of the closest Triathlons ever.  It went down to the last game of darts before a winner was determined.

Bob Lenhof had a slight ¼ point lead going into Darts.

Ron Toole & Dave Gregory were tied for 2nd & 3rd.  Dave Foreman was in a close 4th and only ½ point off the lead.

But Ron Toole took the lead and was tasting his first potential crown by winning the first game of darts (Cricket). 

But Dave Gregory took the lead after game 2 (401 double out).

Then Dave Gregory clinched it with a 2nd place showing in the last game (301 double in/out).

Other Highlights (and Lowlights)


Dave Foreman had his best showing in bowling ever (scored in all 3 games…3rd, 5th, 2nd)
Rick Jones had his greatest moment in bowling ever with a 2nd place showing in game #2
Daren Ziska blew a potential 2nd place showing in game #1 of bowling by opening in the 8th, 9th, and 10th frame
Daren made up for it with a strong showing in pool (2nd place in Run and 5th place in 9-Ball)
Dave Gregory only lost one game of 8-Ball
Ron Toole couldn’t beat anyone in 8-Ball or 9-Ball (placed last in each)
Dave Foreman swept Bob Lenhof in 8-Ball & 9-Ball (placed 1st in 9-Ball)
The Elite-5 are starting to hear the pitter-patter of other triathletes behind them (But are still dominating)
